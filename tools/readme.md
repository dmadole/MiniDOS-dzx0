# ZX0 Tools

This directory contains a copy of Einar Saukas' ZX0 compressor and
decompressor in C. Documentation and possible updates may be found at
https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0

These are provided for convenience in generating or verifying compressed date and none of these files are needed to build or use the 1802 compressor.

Note that these files for the compressor are licensed differently from the
decompressor, and from the 1802 decompressor.
